You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-dashboard
```

To create the `dashboard_tiles` table, you must create and run the migration.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Dashboard\DashboardServiceProvider" --tag="dashboard-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You must publish the `dashboard` config file with this command.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Dashboard\DashboardServiceProvider" --tag="dashboard-config"
```

This is the content of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The dashboard supports these themes:
     *
     * - light: always use light mode
     * - dark: always use dark mode
     * - device: follow the OS preference for determining light or dark mode
     * - auto: use light mode when the sun is up, dark mode when the sun is down
     */
    'theme' => 'light',

    /*
     * When the dashboard uses the `auto` theme, these coordinates will be used
     * to determine whether the sun is up or down
     */
    'auto_theme_location' => [
        'lat' => 51.260197,
        'lng' => 4.402771,
    ],
];
```

In order for the dashboard to run constantly without anybody having to refresh it every once in a while, you need to add an exception for Livewire routes in your `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware (/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php):

```php
protected $except = [
    '/livewire/*',
];
```
Livewire uses AJAX requests to update the components. Those AJAX requests contain a [CSRF token](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/csrf#csrf-x-csrf-token), and at some point that token will expire and you will see a `419 Page Expired` error in your dashboard. This will prevent it from happening.
